<h1><b>Notes Recognizer 1.0 </b></h1>
Start date: 2013

This is my research project in music notes recognition.
The application allows you to convert <b>.wav</b> files into <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" target="_blank">.midi</a></b> files. The algorithm recognizes and gives you list of notes with their startTime/duration information. Any digital audio workstations can read such .midi files.

The current alghotihm is pretty weak. But anyway you can test the application with an example file RiversFlowInYou.wav that you can find in the example folder and check out a nice result. But, I've found out very interesting approaches recently. That's why a very strong algorithm is on the way! This includes <b>Hidden Markov Models</b>, <b>MFCC</b> and clusterization. I'll publish it very soon. Stay tuned!

You need <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/" target="_blank">xmlgraphics</a> to compile the project.
