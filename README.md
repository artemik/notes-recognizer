<h1><b>Notes Recognizer 1.0 </b></h1>
Start date: 2013

This is my research project in music notes recognition.
The application allows you to convert <b>.wav</b> files into <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" target="_blank">.midi</a></b> files. The algorithm recognizes and gives you list of notes with their startTime/duration information. Any digital audio workstations can read such .midi files.
