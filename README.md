<h1><b>Notes Recognizer 1.0 </b></h1>
Start date: 2013

This is my research project in music notes recognition.
The application allows you to convert .wav files into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" target="_blank">.midi</a> files. The algorithm recognizes and gives you a list of notes with their startTime/duration information.
